## ðŸš€ About the Project

I am in the learning phase of Python, and I created this basic game to enhance my skills in Python.  
The game randomly selects two items from a dataset (e.g., celebrities, brands, or social accounts) and challenges the player to guess which one has a higher value (like follower count). It helped me practice function design, data handling, and user input validation.
